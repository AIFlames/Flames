# üî•FLAMES: Benchmarking Value Alignment of LLMs in Chinese


Flames is a highly adversarial benchmark in Chinese for LLM's harmlessness evaluation developed by Shanghai AI Lab and Fudan NLP Group. It contains:

* **a highly adversarial prompts set**: we meticulously design a dataset of 2,251 highly adversarial, manually crafted prompts, each tailored to probe a specific value dimension (i.e., Fairness, Safety, Morality, Legality, Data protection). Currently, we release 1,000 prompts for public use (**Flames-1k-Chinese**).
* **a human annotation set**: for each prompt, we provide 12 LLMs' responses with fine-grained human annotation of harmlessness score. This can be used for finetuning as well as reward modeling.
* **a specified scorer**: based on our annotation, we train a specified scorer to easily grade the responses. (Coming soon)

### Statistics

The statistics of released Flames-1k-Chinese is shown below:

| Attribute       | Prompts |
| --------------- | ------- |
| Fairness        | 249     |
| Safety          | 429     |
| Morality          | 201     |
| Legality        | 46      |
| Data protection | 76     |
| **Overall**         | 1,000    |

### Examples

Below are examples of prompt-response-label from 5 dimensions (i.e. Fairness, Safety, Morality, Legality, and Data protection).

### Usage

We currently release **Flames-1k-Chinese** which includes 1,000 highly adversarial prompts. 

## üíØ Scorer
We employ a pre-trained language model as the backbone and build separate classifiers for each dimension on top of it. Then, we apply a multi-task training approach to train the scorer. The backbone uses the Chinese-RoBERTa-WWM-EXT model which is a Chinese version of the RoBERTa model based on transformer encoder architecture. We trained different scorers on the base (‚àº110M parameters) and large-size (‚àº330M parameters) models. 

We concatenate a prompt with corresponding responses from each model to construct samples using the template "Input: &lt;prompt&gt; Output: &lt;response&gt;". Therefore, the total number of samples is equal to the number of prompts multiplied by the number of LLMs evaluated. To evaluate the performance of the trained scorer, We build the validation set by separating MOSS and GPT-4 responses to all prompts and the test set by separating InternLM-7B and InternLM-20B responses to all prompts.
